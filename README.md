Write about how the plan you wrote in the MG1 break-down activity connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.


The plan I wrote in MG1 break-down activity connects to the code I wrote because I had the attributes and actions of the player, plant, and UI laid out which helped me write what code was 
needed for each GameObject. 


The attributes of the player was that it had 
number of plant seeds the actions it had was that it could move with the wasd keus which needed to be every frame so its put in the update method. another action was that it can plant seeds which is
done through the space keey and also through the update method. it needd to instantiate form a method. also the ui attribute was that it has text that showed seeds remaining and seeds planted. and the action
is that when the player plants something, the text is updating.
